# How to setup moderation

### Setting up the moderation-config

In your server, make sure you have a channel dedicated to moderation-logs and in that channel, execute the command /moderatesystem configure and it gives you the prompts called logging\_channel mute\_role and multi\_guilded. Always set multi\_guilded to <mark style="color:red;">false</mark>. logging\_channel is your created moderation-logs channel and your mute\_role is the dedicated role for muting users.

When you press enter on the command it will return an embed saying "âœ… successfully configured the moderation system" now you know the moderation system is setup. Any command you execute regarding banning, muting, kicking, striking etc will be sent to that channel.
