# Demerit

When executing the /demerit command it prompts you with three options: user, amount and reason.

When choosing your user, make sure they have merits already or it will return "This user has no merits" When inputting an amount make sure you only input an amount which is more than the user has. For example, a user has 56 merits, you do /demerit user 43&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">Never exceed the amount of merits they have in total or it will return an error.</mark>
