# Merit

When executing the /merit command it will give you three options: user, amount, reason

When giving these you should usually always give a reason just to not be deemed as abusing the service or we will have a temporary lock on the system for users who abuse it.

An example of this command would be

<mark style="color:blue;">"/merit fasttrackstudios 12 Good work within Flexa Services"</mark>

When you execute the command it will return an embed saying "merit given to {user} {amount} {reason} and it will log it to your designated mod log channel.
