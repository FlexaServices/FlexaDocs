# Destrike

When executing the /destrike command it prompts you with three options: user, amount and reason.

When choosing your user, make sure they have strikes already or it will return "This user has no strikes " When inputting an amount make sure you only input an amount which is more than the user has. For example, a user has 6 strikes, you do /destrike user 43&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">Never exceed the amount of merits they have in total or it will return an error.</mark>
