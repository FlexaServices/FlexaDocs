# Ticket rename

When executing the command /ticketrename it prompts you with a text field to input onto. For example: <mark style="color:blue;">/ticketrename Higher Needed</mark>

That will then send a message back to you which others can't see saying "channel renamed" and then it will of renamed the thread channel.
