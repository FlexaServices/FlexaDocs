<mark style="color:yellow;">**Why am I blacklisted?**</mark>

There are quite a few factors as to why you got blacklisted from Flexa? A main competing factor to get blacklisted from Flexas services is for abusing our commands. Another factor is for trolling and getting reported for mass trolling/spamming of the commands. That may fall under abusing under your terms but at Flexa it is a different factor.

<mark style="color:yellow;">How do I get unblacklisted?</mark>

To get unblacklisted you can join our Discord Server, create a ticket and explain to us why you think you should be unblacklisted. We would like proof of your blacklist, as we only accept appeals after 3 days of blacklist.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Can I get permanently blacklisted with no appeal?</mark>

At Flexa we love to give out second and third chances. But after you exceeding your third chance we will have to permanently blacklist you from our services.

<mark style="color:yellow;">What do I do if I don't get accepted on my appeal?</mark>

If you don't get accepted you can wait 7 days from your first appeal to try again, in that period it is the best to think of some good reasons as to why you should be blacklisted. We do like a good list at Flexa. Consisting of a minimum of 5 reasons would make us very impressed.
