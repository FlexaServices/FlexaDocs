# Help

When you execute the /help command it will send an embed back to you in the channel with three buttons at the bottom, a left arrow, a home button, a right arrow. When clicking them, it will scroll through the different types of commands we have, Admin, Moderation, Misc, and Public.&#x20;

You can use Help to know what each command does.
